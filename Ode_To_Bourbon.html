[Intro]
G  G  Em  C   x2
 
 
[Verse 1]
    G                                              Em     C
I remember their names, as I fan the flames to the fire
       G                                              Em       C
Just a stiff one and Waylon are the only two things I desire
            G
It's been a damn long year, and it really don't help
     Em                     C
That I really ain't been to good to myself
      G                                                 Em   C
Cause I can't get past all this pain and depression I'm in
 
 
[Chorus]
   G                   Em      C
So sing me, sing me to sleep
    G               Em    C
And pour me another drink
       G
Well I don't know what happened between bourbon and man
         Em                     C
But I'll be at the gates with a glass in my hand
    G                                                 Em
And tell old Saint Peter quite frankly I don't give a damn
         C                       G
I'm sure one day I'll pay for my sins

G  Em  C
 
 
[Verse 2]
          G                                               Em     C
I've been angry and loathsomе, but that really ain't no excuse
      G                                             Em      C
To bе putting myself through all of this substance abuse
         G
But I'll still take a trip to that old liquor store
      Em                    C
Buy a bottle of rye and end up on the floor
     G                                         Em      C
They call it addiction, but I see it as an old friend
 
 
[Chorus]
   G                   Em      C
So sing me, sing me to sleep
    G               Em     C
And pour me another drink
       G
Well I don't know what happened between bourbon and man
         Em                     C
But I'll be at the gates with a glass in my hand
    G                                                 Em
And tell old Saint Peter quite frankly I don't give a damn
         C                       G
I'm sure one day I'll pay for my sins

G  G  Em  C
 
 
[Chorus]
   G                   Em      C
So sing me, sing me to sleep
    G              Em      C
And pour me another  drink
        G
Well I don't know what happened between bourbon and man
         Em                     C
But I'll be at the gates with a glass in my hand
    G                                                 Em
And tell old Saint Peter quite frankly I don't give a damn
         C                       G
I'm sure one day I'll pay for my sins
