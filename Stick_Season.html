[Intro]
A
 
[Verse 1]
N.C.   A
As you promised me that I was more than all the miles combined
              E
You must have had yourself a change of heart like halfway through the drive
                 F#m
'Cause your voice trailed off exactly as you passed my exit sign
D
Kept on driving straight and left our future to the right
 
 
[Verse 2]
         A
Now I am stuck between my anger and the blame that I can't face
            E
And memories are something even smoking weed does not replace
         F#m
And I am terrified of weather 'cause I see you when it rains
D
Doc told me to travel but there's COVID on the planes
 
 
[Chorus]
     A/E*                                                  E*
And I love Vermont but it's the season of the sticks and I
 
Saw your mom, she forgot that I existed
        F#m*
And it's half my fault but I just like to play the victim
          D*                       D
I'll drink alcohol till my friends come home for Christmas
        A
And I'll dream each night of some version of you
      E
That I might not have but I did not lose
         F#m
Now you're tire tracks and one pair of shoes
       D                         E                   A
And I'm split in half but that'll have to do ooh ooh
 
 
[Verse 3]
N.C. A
So I thought that if I piled something good on all my bad
             E
That I could cancel out the darkness I inherited from dad
        F#m
No, I am no longer funny 'cause I miss the way you laugh
    D
You once called me forever, now you still can't call me back
 
 
[Chorus]
     A/E                                                   E
And I love Vermont but it's the season of the sticks and I
 
Saw your mom, she forgot that I existed
        F#m
And it's half my fault but I just like to play the victim
          D
I'll drink alcohol till my friends come home for Christmas
        A
And I'll dream each night of some version of you
      E
That I might not have but I did not lose
         F#m
Now you're tire tracks and one pair of shoes
       D                         E                   A
And I'm split in half but that'll have to do ooh ooh
 
 
[Bridge]
A                     E
Oh, that'll have to do
                F#m
My other half was you
                        D
I hope this pain's just passing through
      E
But I doubt it
 
 
[Chorus]
     A/E*                                                  E*
And I love Vermont but it's the season of the sticks and I
 
Saw your mom, she forgot that I existed
        F#m*
And it's half my fault but I just like to play the victim
          D*                       D
I'll drink alcohol till my friends come home for Christmas
        A
And I'll dream each night of some version of you
      E
That I might not have but I did not lose
         F#m
Now you're tire tracks and one pair of shoes
       D                         E
And I'm split in half but that'll have to do
              A*
Have to do ooh
