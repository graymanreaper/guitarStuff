[Verse 1: Mark Hall]
             Em
Why You ever chose me
    C             G
Has always been a mystery
       Em
All my life, I've been told I belong
       C          G
At the end of the line
                   Em
With all the other Not-Quites
     C             G
With all the Never-Get-It-Rights
       Em
But it turns out they're the ones You were looking for
C        G
All this time
 
 
[Chorus: Mark Hall & Matthew West]
                  Em     C              G
'Cause I'm just a nobody trying to tell everybody
          Em           C        G
All about Somebody who saved my soul
               Em              C               G
Ever since You rescued me, You gave my heart a song to sing
                   C        G              D Em
I'm living for the world to see nobody but Jesus
                   C        G              D G
I'm living for the world to see nobody but Jesus
 
 
[Verse 2: Matthew West]
          Em
Moses had stage fright
    C               G
And David brought a rock to a sword fight
           Em
You picked twelve outsiders nobody would've chosen
        C           G
And You changed the world
                       Em
Well, the moral of the story is
     C            G
Everybody's got a purpose
          Em
So when I hear that devil start talking to me, saying
     C                G
"Who do you think you are?" I'll say...
 
 
[Chorus: Mark Hall & Matthew West]
                  Em     C              G
...I'm just a nobody trying to tell everybody
          Em           C        G
All about Somebody who saved my soul
               Em              C               G
Ever since You rescued me, You gave my heart a song to sing
                   C        G              D Em
I'm living for the world to see nobody but Jesus
                   C        G              D G
I'm living for the world to see nobody but Jesus
 
 
[Bridge: [Megan Garrett?] & Mark Hall]
             G                   C
So let me go down, down, down in history
           G                                   D
As another blood-bought faithful member of the family
            Em                               A
And if they all forget my name, well, that's fine with me
                   C        G              D G
I'm living for the world to see nobody but Jesus
             G                   C
So let me go down, down, down in history (Go down in history)
           G                                   D
As another blood-bought faithful member of the family (It's all I ever wanna 
be)
            Em                               A
And if they all forget my name, well, that's fine with me
                   N.C.
I'm living for the world to see nobody but Jesus, yeah
 
 
[Chorus: Mark Hall & Matthew West]
           Em
I'm just a nobody (Nobody)
C              G
Trying to tell everybody
          Em
All about Somebody
    C        G
Who saved my soul (Oh, saved my, saved my soul)
               Em
Ever since You rescued me
    C               G
You gave my heart a song to sing (You gave me a song to sing)
                   C        G
I'm living for the world to see
           D Em
Nobody but Jesus (Nobody but You, Lord)
                   C        G              D G
I'm living for the world to see nobody but Jesus
 
 
[Outro: Mark Hall & Matthew West]
                   C        G              D G
I'm living for the world to see nobody but Jesus
